# Flashcards
We build an application, which connects to the local sqlite database using sqlalchemy and
remebers givent q/a pair called flashcard. One of flashcards is displayed every time you're
using an app. 

Possible actions with cards: adding, changing, deleting. 

After each question user will be asked whether he remembers an answer,
cards are deleted from sqlite database based on Leitner system.
